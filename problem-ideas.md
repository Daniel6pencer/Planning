# Problems an Assistive Robot may Help to Solve

* Drug sorting
  * Sort medication by day and put into containers (benefits chemists who usually do this by hand)  
  * Something similar in the home which reminds them to take their medication, picks out the correct medication and how much to be taking at the right time of day

* Help with mass vaccination?

* Some people with learning disabilities may find money difficult to manage (e.g identifying which note/coin denotes the correct amount)

* Some people have difficulty getting in and out of the shower alone
  * Intelligently aid balancing them?

* Identifying which bottle in the shower is shampoo/conditioner/shower gel

* Struggle to wash themselves/reach certain areas (could be due to physical or mental disability or even just temporary pain)
